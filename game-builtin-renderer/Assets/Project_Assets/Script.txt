TITLE: Introduction 

NAME: Narrator 
Boring. Crude. Unkosher. 
These were just a few of the things said of Claymore Ham’s 1986 debut. 
Money was lost, careers ruined, and a once full-of-potential arcade franchise was quietly killed off. 
However… 

/ 

NAME: Claymore Ham 
Wow, I can really stretch out here.. 
I’m pretty sure there’s only like 8 kilobytes of data in there. 
Wow! Mr. Punkrock got a new game! 
I remember him from the arcade where I made my debut. 
Wait, so did The Legend of Imelda! 
…and Quack-man…

NAME: Developer 1 

Woah, I totally forgot you existed! 
We made you like 40 years ago!

NAME: Claymore Ham 
And I’ve been stuck in here all this time?!

NAME: Developer 2 
Well yeah; 
you sold really badly, so you never got a sequel or anything. 

/  

NAME: Claymore Ham 
Well, I don’t think it’s too late. 
Reboot me, I’m ready for 2022!

NAME: Narrative Designer 
You know they’ll never reboot you, right? You don’t belong here anymore!

NAME: Claymore Ham 
We’ll see about that. 
If I just get a little more hip to the times, they can’t possibly say no! 

/  


NAME: Narrative Designer 
No one talks like that anymore. Urk. 

/  

 

NAME: Claymore Ham 
Well, I’ll just take this cool new weapon off of you 
and then maybe we’ll see who wants to reboot me!

I like the sound of what you’re working on. 
How about you bring your skills over to my game?

Are… Are you from Angry Birds? Did we make that? 
I literally have no idea what we do anymore.

TITLE: Level 2 Boss Intro 

NAME: Claymore Ham 


Ugh, what is this melodramatic nonsense? 
Back in my day, game music had style, flair, and like… 
Melodies! What happened to the old composer?! 

/   

 
NAME: Composer
Your game came out like forty years ago, dude. I’d say probably retired?  

/  

 
NAME: Claymore Ham
Well, I hope you put more effort than this into the sound for MY big return!

NAME: Composer 
*Sigh* They don’t pay me enough to deal with this. 
Or anything. Ugh.

Ugh… This studio doesn’t have health care…

NAME: Claymore Ham 
I didn’t like his music anyways; not my tempo. 
I’m feeling more modern anyways!

NAME: Claymore Ham 
Well, I hope you put more effort than this into the sound for MY big return!

NAME: Claymore Ham 
Finally, someone with the ability to do something here! You MADE my game in the first place!

Did I? I make a lot of games, you’re going to have to be more specific.

NAME: Claymore Ham 
You don’t remember? 
It was the most important release of 1986!

NAME: Creative Director 
To you, maybe. No one asked us to reboot you.

NAME: Claymore Ham 
Well, I am!

NAME: Creative Director 
Let’s get this over with;
I have a stand-up at 2pm to determine how unrealistic our horse physics should be.

And you better let me use my new powers, too!
